# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Convolutional Neural Network that can predict input dog breed image with upto 98% accuracy. üê∂

# How to Run
1. To run the small test file please make sure to download the [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) and [Stanford Dog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
2. Then pick out the relevant subset of dog breeds and place these folders in the same level as the ipynb file and make sure these subsets are identified in the code.
3. Otherwise you can populate your own test images by editing the code and maintaining the same file structure.
